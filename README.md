# 🌍 SignBot
A while back, I worked on a project to make a Discord bot to search for videos of words in American Sign Language, convert them to GIF format and then embed them into the Discord channel from which they originated.
The project is in a mostly-finished state. However, slash commands will probably not be a viable feature if you decide to use this since they rely on custom edits to the DSharpPlus library.
